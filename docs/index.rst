Welcome to LocalSearch’s documentation!
======================================

LocalSearch is a lightweight, privacy-first local semantic search engine powered by embeddings and LLMs.
It lets you index your local files (like .txt, .pdf, .html) and query them using natural language,
all without sending your data to external servers. You can plug in your own LLM, embedder, vector store,
or metadata backend to customize the system to your needs.
